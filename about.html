          <p class="bio">
            Bilingual (Spanish/English) Computer Software developer-in-training
            at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. I love building things
            from front-end to back-end. I am most attracted with designing the
            visual aspect of Web Applications but am open to solving real
            customer problems in the client side of Web Development. What keeps
            me going are these core values I truly cherish whether it is in the
            field and in life.

            Disciplined
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this type of industry, writing clean code that is easy to
            understand is a way to be disciplined within the tech community.
          </p>
          <h3 class="Core-title">
            Perseverance
          </h3>
          <p>
            As a lot of us experienced, web development or coding in general can
            be very difficult at times. After witnessing classmates mishandle
            difficulties, I managed to hold myself together and get things done.
            This type of quality will definitely transfer to the workplace.

            Reliability
          </h3>
          <p>
            Just like any job, being reliable while having a deadline is what I
            been used to in college and it will easily transfer to the
            workplace.
          </p>
          <h3 class="Core-title">
            Open minded-ness
          </h3>
          <p>
            Working with others and throwing our ideas in the mix made it easier
            for me to get my projects done. It gave me new ideas and made me
            approach problems differently.

            Consistency
          </h3>
          <p>
            When working on a project especially in a team, having short term
            goals during the week but also using a methodology like scrum on a
            daily basis can prevent late deployments within your project in
            order to properly deliver it to your client.
          </p>
          <h3 class="Core-title">
            Teamwork
          </h3>
          <p>
            As an athlete being a good teammate requires communication,
            positivity, and most importantly teamwork. Playing sports taught me
            to trust, and learn from others. When adversity hit, it taught me
            and my team to stick together and solve the problem. These are
            traits that will transfer to the workplace!
