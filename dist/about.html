                <p class="bio"> I am a developer-in-training at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.
                    I love building things from front-end to back-end. I am most attracted to solving
                    real customer problems in the UI but also enjoys the obstacles the server side of
                    software brings to me. I am still trying to find myself in this field. What keeps me going
                    are these core values I truly cherish whether is in the field or life in general.

                    Core Values
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <h5>Disciplined
                    </h5>
                    <li>Being disciplined is one of the most important core values you could attain,
                        showing control of your behavior when being told what to do and how to do it is very
                        important.
                    </li> 
                    <h5>Perseverance
                    </h5>
                    <li>This right here is the key to success, it doesn’t matter how much knowledge you have in
                        your
                        field if you are determined enough to make it happen it will happen whether you want to
                        learn
                        JS,
                        or C ++ you’ll always find a way. I firmly believe this is the most important trait a
                        person
                        could have. 
                    </li>
                    <h5>Humble</h5>
                    <li> You need to show interest and in other people’s perspectives or point of view in things,
                        it will make your life a lot easier because you will constantly
                        find new ways to finish or approach projects in different ways.

                <p>Ever since I was a little boy I played sports. I think playing team sports builds character
                    but also gives you an insight to probem solving skills at an early age.

                <p>I am currently interested in an internship that involves computer software.
                    I have very high interest in building my skills and expanding my knowledge in technology.
                    I am second year student at Thaddeus Stevens majoring in Computer Software Engineering.
